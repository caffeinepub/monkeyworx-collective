# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Transform the MONKEYWORX COLLECTIVE website with a complete cyberpunk visual overhaul featuring animated VHS static overlay, redesigned logo with geometric monkey icon, tactical UI elements, glitch effects, and cyberpunk styling throughout.

**Planned changes:**
- Add animated VHS static/digital noise overlay at 5-10% opacity on top of solid #000000 background
- Replace text-based logo with geometric monkey icon + 'MONKEYWORX', 'COLLECTIVE', and '& CO.' text in cyberpunk styling
- Apply RGB split/flicker glitch effects and neon cyan/hot pink glow to the new logo
- Add hero headline 'THE RARE HOLI GRAIL EVENT' above Holi Grail poster with heavy digital glitch font and chromatic aberration
- Frame Holi Grail poster in tactical glowing border resembling digital dossier
- Apply tactical UI corner borders (targeting reticle style) to all container elements
- Implement random horizontal line glitches across background and over images
- Redesign buttons to be transparent with neon cyan borders, turning solid hot pink with digital distortion on hover
- Add fade-in scroll animations with vertical jitter effect as content enters viewport
- Store uploaded geometric monkey logos and Holi Grail poster as static assets

**User-visible outcome:** The MONKEYWORX COLLECTIVE website will have a complete cyberpunk aesthetic with animated terminal effects, a redesigned logo featuring the geometric monkey icon, tactical UI elements throughout, and immersive glitch effects that create a live digital terminal experience while maintaining all existing functionality.
